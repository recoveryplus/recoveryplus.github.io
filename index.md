# About Recovery Plus
Recovery Plus is an innovative recovery programme that draws inspiration from Neuro-Linguistic Programmming (NLP) as well as other recovery programmes.

The "Plus" simply means it is an additional perspective on recovery and is not necessarily the only way to work recovery. It can also be used in conjunction with other programmes and approaches.

## Step 1: Admitted our core beliefs were unhelpful

### Our beliefs create our feelings
Right now your feelings are being determined by your beliefs. For example, you may believe:
- "I am not good enough"
- "I am unworthy"
- "The world is a cruel and unforgiving place"
- "Life is meaningless and pointless"
- "I shouldn't be here"

### Addiction is to escape feelings
Addictions tend to be used to escape an intolerable reality - our feelings and how we are experience life. Whether the substance is alcohol, drugs, food, sex, love, work, the motive tends to be the same - to numb or escape.

### How recovery happens
Using the Human Experiential Model, we experience life on five major levels:
- Spiritual (core beliefs)
- Volitional (decision making)
- Intellectual (thinking)
- Emotional (feeling)
- Physical (doing)

Recovery Plus focuses on the <strong>Spiritual Level</strong>. Why?

If we change our core beliefs, we then impact our decision making, which then affects our thinking, feeling and doing. This is how recovery happens!
