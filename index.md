# About Recovery Plus
Recovery Plus is an innovative recovery programme that draws inspiration from Neuro-Linguistic Programmming (NLP) as well as other recovery programmes.

The "Plus" simply means it is an additional perspective on recovery and is not necessarily the only way to work recovery. It can also be used in conjunction with other programmes and approaches.

## Step 1: Admitted our core beliefs were unhelpful

Right now your feelings are being determined by your beliefs. For example, you may believe:
"I am not good enough"
"I am unworthy"
"The world is an unsafe and mean place"
"My life is terrible"
"I shouldn't be here"

Addictions tend to be used to escape intolerable feelings. Whether the substance is alcohol, drugs, food, sex, love, work, the motive tends to be the same - to numb or escape.

If we change our feelings without substances, we can recover from addiction. To do this, we change our core beliefs.

Using the Human Experiential Model, we experience life on five major levels:
- Spiritual (core beliefs)
- Volitional (decision making)
- Intellectual (thinking)
- Emotional (feeling)
- Physical (doing)

The level this programme focuses on is the Spiritual level. Why?

If we change our core beliefs, we then change our decision making, thinking, feeling and doing. This is how recovery happens!
