# About Recovery Plus
Recovery Plus is an innovative recovery programme that draws inspiration from Neuro-Linguistic Programmming (NLP) as well as 12-Step.

The "Plus" simply means it is an additional perspective on recovery and is not necessarily the only way to work recovery. It can also be used in conjunction with other programmes.
