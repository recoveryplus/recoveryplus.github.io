# About CORE
CORE is short for The Core Recovery Experience.

From our experience, addiction recovery is not an intellectual exercise. Rather, it is an **experience**. Thus, this paved the way for naming this program.

Furthermore, recovery is not just about stopping addictive behaviour; it is about changing one's core beliefs. The great psychiatrist Carl Jung believed that a 'total psychic shift' needed to happen in order for someone to achieve recovery from addiction. 

For example, if one has an alcohol addiction, they may decide to stop drinking. But if that person still believes they are worthless, that the world is a cruel place, that life is meaningless, then it will only be a matter of time before that person relapses.

Some may call our 'core':
- Our Core Identity
- Our Authentic Self
- Our Soul
- Our Spirituality
- Our Being

Fundamentally, it is **who** you are at your **core**. Things like ego, resentment, fear and shame, cover up this beautiful core that exists in all of us.

Our core consists of our core beliefs about ourselves, others, the world, life, death and so on.

This programme focuses on changing these core beliefs - or rather - stripping away layers to reveal who we really are at our core.
