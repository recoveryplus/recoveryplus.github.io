# Step 1: Admit the unmanageability of the addiction

## 
The first step of CORE is to admit what the addiction has cost you, and to admit that you have lost control.

It is about accepting that your usage has gotten out of control, that it has cost you too much personally, financially, physically, mentally, emotionally and even spiritually. It is about surrendering and accepting that you are sick and tired of being sick and tired - and you need help.

One important distinction of CORE is that you are simply admitting that you have a problem - but you are not the addiction. Admitting that you **have** an addiction does not make you an 'addict'.

In fact, a principle of CORE is to not label yourself as an addict as this only serves to cover up our authentic and precious core.

In CORE, you can simply say "I have an addiction but I am recovering".

### Q1) What has been the cost of your addiction in terms of:
- Number of hours spent using the addiction
- Amount of money spent chasing the next high/fix
- Number of days off sick from work
- Number of days spent unproductively
- Number of lost promotions
- Number of hours of sleep lost
- Number of people hurt from you using the addiction
- Amount of money spent trying to manage the addiction

### Q2) What else has your addiction cost you?
eg. relationships, work promotions, health, dignity, reputation, etc.

### Q3) Why would you like to stop the addiction?

### Q4) What would be the benefits of giving up the addiction?
eg. improved health, improved sleep, improved finances

### Q5) Are you willing to go to any lengths to stop using and recover from the addiction? This is necessary if you want to recover.

### Q6) If so, are you willing to change your core beliefs in order to recover?
