# Step 2: Admit that core beliefs were unhelpful

### Our beliefs create our feelings
Right now your feelings are being determined by your beliefs. For example, you may believe:
- "I am not good enough"
- "I am unworthy"
- "The world is a cruel and unforgiving place"
- "Life is meaningless and pointless"
- "I shouldn't be here"

### Addiction is to escape feelings
Addictions tend to be used to escape an intolerable reality - our feelings and how we are experience life. Whether the substance is alcohol, drugs, food, sex, love, work, the motive tends to be the same - to numb or escape.

### How recovery happens
Using the Human Experiential Model, we experience life on five major levels:
- Core beliefs
- Decision making
- Thinking
- Feeling
- Doing

Our core beliefs affect our decision making, which affects thinking, and thus feeling and actions.

Recovery Plus focuses on making changes at <strong>Core Belief Level</strong>. Why?

If we change our core beliefs, we then impact our decision making, which then affects our thinking, feeling and doing.

This is how recovery happens!

- yourself
- the meaning of life

- other people

### Q2) How are these beliefs not serving you?

### Q3) How do these beliefs make you feel?

### Q4) Assuming these beliefs are not serving you and are causing pain, would you be willing to change them?
