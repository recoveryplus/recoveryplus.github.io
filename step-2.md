# Step 2: Admitted that our core beliefs were unhelpful

### Our beliefs create our feelings
Right now your feelings are being determined by your beliefs. For example, you may believe:
- "I am not good enough"
- "I am unworthy"
- "The world is a cruel and unforgiving place"
- "Life is meaningless and pointless"
- "I shouldn't be here"

### Addiction is to escape feelings
Addictions tend to be used to escape an intolerable reality - our feelings and how we are experience life. Whether the substance is alcohol, drugs, food, sex, love, work, the motive tends to be the same - to numb or escape.

### How recovery happens
Using the Human Experiential Model, we experience life on five major levels:
- Core beliefs
- Decision making
- Thinking
- Feeling
- Doing

Our core beliefs affect our decision making, which affects thinking, and thus feeling and actions.

STAR focuses on making changes at <strong>Core Belief Level</strong>. Why?

If we change our core beliefs, we then impact our decision making, which then affects our thinking, feeling and doing.

This is how recovery happens!

### Q1) What are your beliefs about:
- i) Yourself? Are you worthless? Are you unloveable? Are you not good enough? Are you unattractive?

- ii) The meaning of your life? Do you believe there is no meaning? Is your life meaningless?

- iii) Death? Is there an after-life? Is there darkness for all eternity?

- iv) The world and other people? Are all people selfish? Are all people bad? Is the world cruel and unforgiving?

- v) There being a 'Higher Power'? Are they cruel? Can they provide for you? Are they out to get you?

### Q2) Beliefs determine our decision making, thinking, feelings and actions. For each belief in Q1, write about how these beliefs make you:
- i) Make decisions
- ii) Think
- iii) Feel
- iv) Act

### Q3) For each belief in Q1, what age did you first create or believe these beliefs?

### Q4) Assuming these beliefs are not serving you and are causing you pain, would you be willing to change them?
