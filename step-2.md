# Step 2: Admit that core beliefs were unhelpful

### Our beliefs create our feelings
Right now your feelings are being determined by your beliefs. For example, you may believe:
- "I am not good enough"
- "I am unworthy"
- "The world is a cruel and unforgiving place"
- "Life is meaningless and pointless"
- "I shouldn't be here"

### Addiction is to escape feelings
Addictions tend to be used to escape an intolerable reality - our feelings and how we are experience life. Whether the substance is alcohol, drugs, food, sex, love, work, the motive tends to be the same - to numb or escape.

### How recovery happens
Using the Human Experiential Model, we experience life on five major levels:
- Core beliefs
- Decision making
- Thinking
- Feeling
- Doing

Our core beliefs affect our decision making, which affects thinking, and thus feeling and actions.

Recovery Plus focuses on making changes at <strong>Core Belief Level</strong>. Why?

If we change our core beliefs, we then impact our decision making, which then affects our thinking, feeling and doing.

This is how recovery happens!

### Q1) What are your beliefs about:
- yourself?
- the meaning of life?
- death?
- the world?
- people who have made you angry?

### Q2) How do these beliefs make you feel?

### Q3) Think about all the people, things, institutions in your life who you are angry towards today.
- How does it not serve you to carry resentment and anger today?
- 'Everyone is doing the best they can with their available resources.' Could that also be true for those you resent?
- Does anyone MAKE you feel angry, or are you CHOOSING to be angry?
- 'Empowerment comes via responsibility'. How does being resentful disempower you?
- What is your part in creating the resentment or scenarios? Could it be choosing to be angry today?
- How much happier and freer would you be if you could let go of this anger and resentment?
- Would you be willing to let go of this anger and resentment?

### Q4) Assuming these beliefs are not serving you and are causing pain, would you be willing to change them?
