# Step 2: Admit that core beliefs were unhelpful

### Our beliefs create our feelings
Right now your feelings are being determined by your beliefs. For example, you may believe:
- "I am not good enough"
- "I am unworthy"
- "The world is a cruel and unforgiving place"
- "Life is meaningless and pointless"
- "I shouldn't be here"

### Addiction is to escape feelings
Addictions tend to be used to escape an intolerable reality - our feelings and how we are experience life. Whether the substance is alcohol, drugs, food, sex, love, work, the motive tends to be the same - to numb or escape.

### How recovery happens
Using the Human Experiential Model, we experience life on five major levels:
- Core beliefs
- Decision making
- Thinking
- Feeling
- Doing

Our core beliefs affect our decision making, which affects thinking, and thus feeling and actions.

Recovery Plus focuses on making changes at <strong>Core Belief Level</strong>. Why?

If we change our core beliefs, we then impact our decision making, which then affects our thinking, feeling and doing.

This is how recovery happens!

### Q1) What are your beliefs about:
- i) Yourself? Are you worthless? Are you unloveable? Are you not good enough? Are you unattractive?
- ii) The meaning of your life? For example, do you believe there is no meaning? Is your life meaningless?
- iii) Death? For example, is there an after-life? Is there nothingness for all eternity?
- iv) The world and other people? Are all people selfish? Is the world cruel and unforgiving?
- v) God? Is there a God? If there is, are they cruel? Are they out to get you? Are they heartless?

### Q2) Beliefs determine our decision making, thinking, feelings and actions. For each belief in Q1, write about how these beliefs make you:
- i) Make decisions
- ii) Think
- iii) Feel
- iv) Act

### Q3) Assuming these beliefs are not serving you and are causing you pain, would you be willing to change them?
