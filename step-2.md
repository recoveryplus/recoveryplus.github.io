# Step 2: Admit that core beliefs were unhelpful

### Our beliefs create our feelings
Right now your feelings are being determined by your beliefs. For example, you may believe:
- "I am not good enough"
- "I am unworthy"
- "The world is a cruel and unforgiving place"
- "Life is meaningless and pointless"
- "I shouldn't be here"

### Addiction is to escape feelings
Addictions tend to be used to escape an intolerable reality - our feelings and how we are experience life. Whether the substance is alcohol, drugs, food, sex, love, work, the motive tends to be the same - to numb or escape.

### How recovery happens
Using the Human Experiential Model, we experience life on five major levels:
- Core beliefs
- Decision making
- Thinking
- Feeling
- Doing

Our core beliefs affect our decision making, which affects thinking, and thus feeling and actions.

Recovery Plus focuses on making changes at <strong>Core Belief Level</strong>. Why?

If we change our core beliefs, we then impact our decision making, which then affects our thinking, feeling and doing.

This is how recovery happens!

### Q1) What are your beliefs about:
- yourself?
- the meaning of your life?
- death?
- the world?
- other people in general?
- God?

### Q2) 'Our beliefs determine our thinking, feelings and actions' How do these beliefs make you:
- Think?
- Feel?
- Act?

### Q3) We often use our addictions to escape fear, anger and shame.

i) Write a list of who or what are you angry towards, and why. Then for each resentment, apply at least one of the tools for reducing anger.

#### Tools for Reducing Anger
- **OWNERSHIP**: Who is responsible for how you feel right now? What part do you have in creating the anger today?

- **EXPLORATION**: Anger is often a protection mechanism for fear. What fear is your anger covering up?

- **COMPASSION**: Everyone is doing the best they can with the resources they have available. Is it possible those you are angry towards are spiritually and/or mentally sick? Is there such thing as a perfect person? Are we all imperfect beings who have made mistakes in our lives? How might you practice compassion?

- **PERSPECTIVE**: How might your actions be perceived by those you are angry towards? How may have you harmed them?

- **PRIORITIES**: How much will this resentment matter at the end of your life? What other things might be much more important than this resentment?

- **GRATITUDE**: Those who you may be angry with may have helped you learn something about yourself. Perhaps they have shown you what core values matter the most to you, such as integrity, loyalty, humility. How might you thank them for the lesson?

- **EMPOWERMENT**: It disempowers you to let others control how you feel. How could you take back this control?

- **ACCEPTANCE**: We cannot change the past. How can you accept what has happened? How would it feel to let go of this anger?


ii) Write a list of who or what you are fearful of, and why. Then for each fear, apply at least one of the tools for reducing fear.

#### Tools for Reducing Fear
- FAITH: Faith is the opposite of fear. What or who can you believe in? How can you practice faith?
- RATIONALITY: Realistically speaking, what is the absolute worst that can happen?
- PERSPECTIVE: All fear originates back to the Original Fear - the fear of death.

### Further questions ###
- How does it not serve you to carry resentment and anger today?
- 'Everyone is doing the best they can with their available resources.' Could that also be true for those you resent?
- Does anyone MAKE you feel angry, or are you CHOOSING to be angry?
- 'Empowerment comes via responsibility'. How does being resentful disempower you?
- What is your part in creating the resentment or scenarios? Could it be choosing to be angry today?
- How much happier and freer would you be if you could let go of this anger and resentment?
- Would you be willing to let go of this anger and resentment?

### Q4) Assuming these beliefs are not serving you and are causing pain, would you be willing to change them?
