# Step 3: Change your core beliefs

If we believe that life is meaningless, we will live a meaningless life.

If we believe that life is meaningful, we will live a meaningful life.

Ultimately, we can choose what meaning we give to life and past events.

### Q1) What you believe becomes your reality. Discuss and reflect how this is true for you.

### Q2) What you believe you will find evidence to support. Discuss and reflect on how this is true for you.

### Q3) Given that your previous beliefs created how you feel, what would you now like to believe about:
- yourself?
- the meaning of your life?
- death?
- the world?
- other people in general?
- A Higher Power?

### Q4) For each new belief you would like to have, write a list of supporting evidence to support why this is belief is true for you.

If you cannot think of any, do not fret; as you start to sincerely believe these new beliefs, you will naturally begin to find evidence to support them.
