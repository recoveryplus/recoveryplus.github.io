# Step 3: Changed our core beliefs

Q1) 'What you believe becomes your reality'. Discuss and reflect how this is true for you.

Q2) 'What you believe you will find evidence to support'. Discuss and reflect on how this is true for you.

Q3) Given that your previous beliefs created how you feel, what would you now like to believe about:
- yourself?
- the meaning of your life?
- death?
- the world?
- other people in general?
- God?

Q4) For each new belief you would like to have, write a list of supporting evidence to support why this is belief is true for you.
If you cannot think of any, do not fret; as you start to sincerely believe these new beliefs, you will naturally begin to find evidence to support them.
